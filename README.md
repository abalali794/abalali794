## 👋 About me

I’m Abdulrahman Alali — I sit at the intersection of healthcare operations and finance, and I’m obsessed with one thing: making the numbers match reality.

I earned a **Master of Health Administration (MHA)**, and I’m currently pursuing a **finance degree** to deepen my technical skills in modeling, valuation, and analytics. 

Earlier in my career, I worked in hospital operations/business operations roles where I learned how performance actually breaks (and how to fix it). I’ve led finance-impact work like a hematology reconciliation project (over $1M+ in scope) and built operational solutions that improved patient access so patients didn’t have to wait longer to receive care.

In the near future, I want to step into a **healthcare FP&A / finance analytics** role where I can own forecasting, service-line performance, and scenario planning—building the kind of models leaders can actually use. Long term, I’m building toward finance leadership in healthcare, grounded in operational reality.

## 🎯 Mission
I build healthcare finance tools that expose **where margin is created, where it leaks, and what limits growth** — then translate that into an executable plan.
